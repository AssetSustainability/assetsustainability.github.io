##	Introduction
Motors@Work is a prolific Cloud based Application system that has multiproged capabilities for interconnectivity. This document covers all the various actors and interfaces that are possible along side the communicaiton channels and protocols that are supported. This is intended for System Level Architects.
## 	How to read this document
The document has 4 different sections. 
### a.	Network Diagram : 
This picture represents all the various components that are involved and their ability to communicate with each other. Against each Component, there is a small circle containing the alphabet denoting the Channels that are supported for cummunication. 
### b.	System Components: 
This contains a list of System components that are involved in the interection.
### c.	Channels : 
These are the Communication Channels indicating the messaging protocls that are supported between the 2 System Component. For e.g. If the circle between Submeters and M@W Application has “ C, D” then that means both Channel “C” and Channel “D” are supported for the interaction between M@W Application and Submeters. 
### d.	Interfaces: 
Finally a list of interfaces or mssages that are supported between the 2 System Components over a Channel.
