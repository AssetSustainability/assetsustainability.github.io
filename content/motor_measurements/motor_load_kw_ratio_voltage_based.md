## kW Ratio - Voltage Based

If the [motor load](/motor-load) cannot be determined using kW Ratio â€“ Power based method,
Motors@Work will attempt to calculate it using the kw Ratio - Voltage Based method.

When using the kW ratio - voltage based method, the motor load is determined with the following
formula

{% highlight java%}
((averageVoltageaverageCurrent(powerFactor/100)0.001732) / ((motor.motorSize.numericValue.746)/(motor.efficiency/100)))*100
{% endhighlight %}
