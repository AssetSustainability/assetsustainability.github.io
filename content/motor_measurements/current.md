## Motor Measurement: Current

Take current readings from each of the lines to allow Motors@Work to calculate the motor load.

The average of the three currents is used in the Voltage Compensated Amps Ratio and kW Ratio â€“ Voltage based calculations.

Motors@Work only considers average currents greater than 1.  If less than one, Motors@Work considers the reading to be the current from instrumentation.
