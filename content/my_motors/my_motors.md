### <a name="Grid"></a> List (Grid)
The My Motors page first opens to a grid that lists all of the motors you track in Motors@Work..  Filter and sort the motors available in the grid using Motors@Work [filtering and sorting](/filter-and-sort-overview).

In the leftmost column of the grid, there are Edit, Delete, and Details buttons.

**Tip: Select a motor to enable details, measurement, and analysis tabs.**

####<a name="Grid Popup"></a> Edit (Grid popup)
Click the edit button in the leftmost column of the grid to bring up a quick edit popup that allows you to modify the values of some of the most used motor fields including description, speed, and size.  All fields viewable in the grid are available in the grid edit popup.

Use the appropriate field to change information about one or more of the motor's attributes.  Once you have completed your changes, click the update button to save your modifications.  You can also choose to cancel your changes by clicking the cancel button on the popup.  Clicking cancel will cause the motor record to revert back to the state of the record before the edit button was clicked.
